Sign in to Power Apps.

Create or edit the main form of an entity, Accounts entity in our example.

In the command bar, select "Switch to classic" to open the form in the classic form designer.

# キャンバスアプリを埋め込みたい場所にセクションを配置する

# 保存する

# クラシックデザイナーに切り替える
In the classic form designer, 
select the section on the form where you want the embedded canvas app to appear.

# セクションに入力必須項目をすべて追加する

Using the field pane, 
add a required field, such as Account Name.

Important

Always use a required field that is guaranteed to have a value.
If your field does not have a value, your embedded canvas app will not refresh in response to any change in data on the host model-driven form.

With the field selected,
on the Home tab in the Edit group,
select Change Properties.

On the Field Properties dialog box, select the Controls tab.


On the Controls tab, select Add Control.

On the Add Control dialog box, in the list of available controls, select Canvas app and then select Add.

On the Field Properties dialog box, in the list of controls select Canvas app, and then select the Web option.

In the section below the controls list, the list of properties available to the canvas app control are displayed.

The Entity name property specifies the entity that will provide the data to your embedded canvas app. It will be set to the entity that contains the field you added in an earlier step.
Notice that, even though this property appears changeable, changing it has no effect on the embedded canvas app. It is meant only to serve as a reference for you.
The App ID property specifies the ID of the embedded canvas app. It will be automatically generated and filled-in for you when the canvas app is created.
Notice that any change to the App ID value breaks the link from the model-driven form to the embedded canvas app.
Select Customize to create or edit the canvas app. This opens Power Apps Studio in a new tab.
 Note

If opening Power Apps Studio is blocked due to a web browser pop-up blocker you must enable the make.powerapps.com site or temporarily disable the pop-up blocker and then select Customize again.

In Power Apps Studio notice that there is a special ModelDrivenFormIntegration control in the left pane. This control is responsible for bringing contextual data from the host model-driven form to the embedded canvas app.
Observe that a canvas app form control was automatically added to your embedded canvas app and displays the data being passed to it from the host model-driven form via the ModelDrivenFormIntegration control.
Select the View tab, and then select Data sources. Notice that a data source for the parent entity of your host model-driven form, Accounts in this case, was automatically added to your embedded canvas app.
Select the Form1 control and observe that the DataSource property is set to Accounts.
With the Form1 control still selected, observe that the Item property is set to ModelDrivenFormIntegration.Item.
 Note

The embedded canvas app has full access to record from the host model-driven form via ModelDrivenFormIntegration.Item. As an example, to get the value of a field with the name accountnumber and display name Account Number, you can use ModelDrivenFormIntegration.Item.accountnumber or ModelDrivenFormIntegration.Item.'Account Number'.

In the property pane on the right, next to Fields, select Edit fields.
Select + Add field to add another field to the canvas app form or reorder existing fields using drag and drop. Close the data pane when you are done adding and reordering fields.
Select the File tab, and then select Save.
Select the The cloud tab. Provide a unique name for the app and then select Save located on the lower right. Note the following:
Saving an app for the first time automatically publishes the app.
On subsequent saves, select Publish and then select Publish this version to make your changes available.
On the menu, select Back.
Select the browser tab that has the classic form designer open. Observe that the App ID property of the canvas app control now has a value automatically filled in.
 Note

The form designer has a direct link with Power Apps Studio that was opened in another browser tab in an earlier step.
The form designer listens for the App ID to be sent to it.
The App ID is sent to the form designer when the app is saved.
On the Field Properties dialog box, select the Display tab.
Clear Display label on the form and then select OK.
If you already have a canvas app embedded on this form, a message is displayed that “Only one canvas app can be enabled on a form.” To add the new canvas app you must first disable the current embedded canvas app. Then, enable the new embedded canvas app.
On the Home tab, select Save, and then select Publish.
After you have added an embedded canvas app to your model-driven form, share your embedded canvas app with other users. More information: Share an embedded canvas app.

When users open a model-driven app (Unified Interface only) that includes the form you have modified, they see the embedded canvas app on the form. Changing the record displayed on the main form changes the data context that is passed to the form, and the embedded app refreshes to show the relevant data.

This topic showed you how to get started with embedding a canvas app in a model-driven form. You can further customize the embedded canvas app to connect and bring in data from a variety of data sources. Use the Filter, Search, and LookUp functions and the context passed in from the host model-driven form to filter or find specific records in those data sources. Use the WYSIWYG canvas app editor to easily design the interface to match your requirements.
